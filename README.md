# POC — Sentry & GrowthBook Integration

A **Proof of Concept** project exploring the integration of [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) for error monitoring and [GrowthBook](https://www.growthbook.io/) for feature flagging & A/B testing in a modern Next.js application.

## Purpose

This project serves as a hands-on exploration to evaluate:

- **Sentry** — Real-time error tracking, performance monitoring, and session replay in a Next.js environment.
- **GrowthBook** — Feature flags, remote configuration, and A/B testing capabilities to enable safe and incremental feature rollouts.

The goal is to validate how these tools work in a Next.js environment and to establish best practices before adopting them in production applications.
